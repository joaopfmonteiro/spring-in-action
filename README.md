# Spring in Action – Study Repository

This repository contains my personal study notes, code examples, and exercises based on the book **"Spring in Action"** by Craig Walls (6th Edition).  
It is organized by chapter to provide a clear and modular approach to learning Spring Framework and Spring Boot.
